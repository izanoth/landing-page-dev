# Research & Decisions

## Technology Stack Selection

- **Decision**: The technology stack was explicitly defined by the user. The project will use Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, and shadcn/ui.
- **Rationale**: This stack was chosen to build a modern, performant, and visually appealing static website, which aligns with the feature specification. The use of shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS will facilitate rapid development of a clean, sophisticated UI.
- **Alternatives considered**: None, as the stack was provided.
